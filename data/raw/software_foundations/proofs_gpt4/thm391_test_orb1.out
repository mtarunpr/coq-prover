PROVING test_orb1
ATTEMPTED EXAMPLE PROOF (LEMMAS USED: 0)






















Inductive day : Type :=
  | monday
  | tuesday
  | wednesday
  | thursday
  | friday
  | saturday
  | sunday.



Definition next_weekday (d:day) : day :=
  match d with
  | monday    => tuesday
  | tuesday   => wednesday
  | wednesday => thursday
  | thursday  => friday
  | friday    => monday
  | saturday  => monday
  | sunday    => monday
  end.





Compute (next_weekday friday).


Compute (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)).






Example test_next_weekday:
  (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)) = tuesday.



Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.









From Coq Require Export String.






Inductive bool : Type :=
  | true
  | false.



Definition negb (b:bool) : bool :=
  match b with
  | true => false
  | false => true
  end.

Definition andb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => b2
  | false => false
  end.

Definition orb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => true
  | false => b2
  end.







Example test_orb1 : (orb true  false) = true.

Proof.
(* Apply the definition of orb with true as the first argument;
     this directly simplifies to true, matching the expected result.
*)
  reflexivity.
Qed.
