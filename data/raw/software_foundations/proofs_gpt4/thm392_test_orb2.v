Compute (next_weekday friday).


Compute (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)).






Example test_next_weekday:
  (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)) = tuesday.

Example test_orb1:  (orb true  false) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.


Example test_orb2 : (orb false false) = false.

Proof.
(* "orb" function definition states that if the first argument is false,
    the result is the second argument.
Therefore "orb false false" is "false".

reflexivity.
